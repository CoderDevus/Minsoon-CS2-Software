Minsoon is proud to offer a free CS2 software that are undetected by the VAC and are suitable for streaming.

You can use our software with OBS, which allows you to record gameplay for YouTube videos or stream without revealing the software. Players commonly refer to this software as ‘stream safe,’ and we offer it for free. You can access our free software after downloading and running the software.
